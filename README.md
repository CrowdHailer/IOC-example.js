Inversion of control architecture for JavaScript applications

- cornerstone
- bedrock
- groundwork
- infrastructure


features are controllers. they have a root element which forms the base of there view. services are stateless parts of the model or ports

should load default broadcaster and logging but both be switch outable

features dont get globals. in fact globals should be single service

Similar app frameworks are

- t3js
- [scaleApp](https://github.com/flosse/scaleApp) coffescript :-(
- [bottlejs](https://github.com/young-steveo/bottlejs) odd
